          Norman Ernest Borlaug ( March 25, 1914 â€“ September 12, 2009) was an
          American agronomist who led initiatives worldwide that contributed to
          the extensive increases in agricultural production termed the Green
          Revolution.

      <h2 id="tribute-info">The life path of Dr. Norman Borlaug</h2>
      <ul id="tribute-list">
        <li id="tribute-item">
          Borlaug received his B.S. in forestry in 1937 and PhD in plant
          pathology and genetics from the University of Minnesota in 1942. He
          took up an agricultural research position with CIMMYT in Mexico, where
          he developed semi-dwarf, high-yield, disease-resistant wheat
          varieties. During the mid-20th century, Borlaug led the introduction
          of these high-yielding varieties combined with modern agricultural
          production techniques to Mexico, Pakistan, and India. As a result,
          Mexico became a net exporter of wheat by 1963. Between 1965 and 1970,
          wheat yields nearly doubled in Pakistan and India, greatly improving
          the food security in those nations.

        <li id="tribute-item">
          Borlaug was the great-grandchild of Norwegian immigrants to the United
          States. Ole Olson Dybevig and Solveig Thomasdatter Rinde, of Feios, a
          small village in Vik kommune, Sogn og Fjordane, Norway, emigrated to
          Dane County, Wisconsin, in 1854. The family eventually moved to the
          small Norwegian-American community of Saude, near Cresco, Iowa. There
          they were members of Saude Lutheran Church, where Norman was baptized
          and confirmed.
        </li>
        <li id="tribute-item">
          From 1942 to 1944, Borlaug was employed as a microbiologist at DuPont
          in Wilmington, Delaware. It was planned that he would lead research on
          industrial and agricultural bacteriocides, fungicides, and
          preservatives. However, following the December 7, 1941, attack on
          Pearl Harbor Borlaug tried to enlist in the military, but was rejected
          under wartime labor regulations; his lab was converted to conduct
          research for the United States armed forces.
        </li>
        <li id="tribute-item">
          Initially, Borlaug's work had been concentrated in the central
          highlands, in the village of Chapingo near Texcoco, where the problems
          with rust and poor soil were most prevalent.
        </li>
        <li id="tribute-item">
          In 1953, Borlaug extended this technique by suggesting that several
          pure lines with different resistance genes should be developed through
          backcross methods using one recurrent parent.
        </li>
        <li id="tribute-item">
          Dwarfing is an important agronomic quality for wheat; dwarf plants
          produce thick stems. The cultivars Borlaug worked with had tall, thin
          stalks.
        </li>
        <li id="tribute-item">
          n 1961 to 1962, Borlaug's dwarf spring wheat strains were sent for
          multilocation testing in the International Wheat Rust Nursery,
          organized by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
        </li>
        <li id="tribute-item">
          For his contributions to the world food supply, Borlaug was awarded
          the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970.
        </li>
        <li id="tribute-item">
          Borlaug continually advocated increasing crop yields as a means to
          curb deforestation. The large role he played in both increasing crop
          yields and promoting this view has led to this methodology being
          called by agricultural economists the "Borlaug hypothesis", namely
          that increasing the productivity of agriculture on the best farmland
          can help control deforestation by reducing the demand for new
          farmland.

          The World Food Prize is an international award recognizing the
          achievements of individuals who have advanced human development by
          improving the quality, quantity or availability of food in the world.
          The prize was created in 1986 by Norman Borlaug, as a way to recognize
          personal accomplishments, and as a means of education by using the
          Prize to establish role models for others.
